                    ACIEDafrica recognizes that disadvantage takes multiple forms of inequalities, and women and girls across the continent
                    are disproportionately affected by deeply rooted social injustice and gender inequalities and a number of structural
                    barriers to sociopolitical and economic empowerment. The obstacles that marginalized people or excluded groups in
                    semi-urban and rural communities especially girls, children, young women, widows, people with disabilities, older
                    persons and non-binary youth often face the most discrimination.

                Keeping gender, equity and inclusion is at the heart of everything we do, ACIEDafrica develops and test scalable
                innovations that enhance opportunities for young lives, particularly girls and young women from poor and vulnerable
                communities, to succeed in life and contribute to society with the conviction that women and men together are
                transformative agents of economic and social change in African economies. We are committed to approaching our work
                through intersectional and gender lens.

                Towards achieving the gender equality and inclusion goal, ACIEDafrica adopts a multi-sectoral approach, as more
                inclusive public policies are essential if Nigeria or Africa is to achieve its poverty reduction targets and achieve
                sustainable economic growth. ACIEDafrica’s strategy to mainstream gender and inclusion perspectives in policymaking is
                to engage government partners and stakeholders to integrate principles and practices that promote gender and inclusion
                in research and policy dialogue. Through such partnership, ACIEDafrica provides technical support to mainstream gender
                and inclusion perspectives and produce gender-sensitive policy recommendation.

                    <h2>Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) Education for Schools and Communities</h2>
                    <br>
                        ACIEDafrica is supporting effective Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) programming and education in schools and
                        communities. Our strategy focuses on four major elements – i. child friendly innovative WASH facilities/infrastructure;
                        ii. hygiene and sanitation best practices through training for school children and teachers; iii. outreach in
                        communities to raise awareness on severity of “period poverty” as a public health, human rights and socio-economic
                        issues; iv.  advocacy for better mensural health education and policies.

                        Our school-based activities are specifically focused on improving children’ enrolment and retention rates in schools
                        through provision of clean water and good sanitation system, and offer training on how to maintain healthy environment.

                        for menstrual hygiene. We also provide special training to female students in public schools on menstrual hygiene
                        management and support girls with free sanitary products to prevent them from infections.
