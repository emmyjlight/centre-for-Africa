                <h1>Our Approach</h1>
                <p>ACIEDafrica considers lack of education and skills mismatches to be principal obstacles for young people in labour
                markets. In Nigeria, lack of proper training has been identified as one of the main reasons why young people do not find
                jobs. Young people therefore need more comprehensive education that responds to labour market needs, in terms of quality
                and relevance (including technical and vocational training). While we recognize youth as an integral to the overall
                global agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), ACIEDafrica is sharpening its focus on inclusive
                entrepreneurship and employment through Entrepreneurial Skills, Technical Vocational Education and Training. The Centre
                is at the forefront of forging purposeful labor market integration by strengthening people’s skills and providing them
                with knowledge, moral and intellectual virtues that form the basis for life-long learning and contribution to the
                national economic growth. We specifically provide rural and semi-urban youth with training and employment opportunities
                that help lift them and their families out of poverty.
